# IM BackEnd Package Control Design Doc

**Date: **2019.10.13

## Goal

We use `dep` to manage packages in our project.

## Dep

One of the most attracting package control tools. We use `dep` to use vendor to save those third parties packages. We don't need to download them manually one by one.
